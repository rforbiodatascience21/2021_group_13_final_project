Group 13's exam project on lung cell data set



The group's work concerns the analysis of the data presented in the following Science Advances publication:
https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/28/eaba1983

The datasets can be found at:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136831
To replicate our work from the raw data files, you need to download and unzip the following patient files.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058963
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058977
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058944
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058936
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058921
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4058907
With these on your drive you can run the code in its entirety. Otherwise the raw downsampled files in the repo can be used, as they were created from these six patients.
